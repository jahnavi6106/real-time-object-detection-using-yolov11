 Project Title - Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv11

 Description - This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using the YOLOv11 model (You Only Look Once, version 11).
It can detect multiple objects in live webcam footage or video files with high accuracy and speed.The system uses the Ultralytics YOLOv11 model 
(an advanced evolution of YOLOv8) for fast and efficient detection across multiple object classes.

Technologies Used...>
1.Python	Programming language
2.YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)	Deep learning object detection model
3.OpenCV	For video capture and real-time frame processing
4.PyTorch	Backend framework for running YOLOv11
5.NumPy	Array handling and frame data manipulation
6.Matplotlib	Optional – for visualization of detection results
7.Google Colab / VS Code	Development environment

Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv11  - Overview...>
This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for detecting multiple objects in a single image or video stream.
The system uses live webcam feed or video files and highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

 Features..>
1.Detects multiple objects in real time
2.Uses YOLOv11 pre-trained model
3.Works with both webcam and video inputs
4.Lightweight and fast
5.Easy to customize for new classes

 Technologies Used..>
1.Python – Core programming language
2.Ultralytics YOLOv11 – Deep learning detection model
3.OpenCV – Real-time video processing
4.PyTorch – Deep learning backend
5.NumPy – Numerical computations

Example Output...>
When you run the code, it opens your webcam and detects objects in real-time — cars, persons, chairs, laptops, bottles, etc.

 How It Works...>
1.YOLOv11 Model: Divides the image into grids and predicts bounding boxes + class probabilities.
2.OpenCV: Captures real-time frames from your camera.
3.Ultralytics Library: Runs YOLOv11 model inference.
4.Visualization: Detected objects are drawn on the frames with bounding boxes and labels.

 Future Improvements....>
1.Add a custom dataset for specific object detection.
2.Integrate tracking (DeepSORT) to follow detected objects across frames.
3.Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
