 Project Title

Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv11

📖 Description

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using the YOLOv11 model (You Only Look Once, version 11).
It can detect multiple objects in live webcam footage or video files with high accuracy and speed.

The system uses the Ultralytics YOLOv11 model (an advanced evolution of YOLOv8) for fast and efficient detection across multiple object classes.

Step 2: Technologies Used

You’ll mention these clearly in your GitHub README:

Technology	Purpose
Python	Programming language
YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)	Deep learning object detection model
OpenCV	For video capture and real-time frame processing
PyTorch	Backend framework for running YOLOv11
NumPy	Array handling and frame data manipulation
Matplotlib	Optional – for visualization of detection results
Google Colab / VS Code	Development environment

⚙️ Step 4: Main Python Script — yolov11_detection.py

Here’s the complete working code you can upload 👇

# yolov11_detection.py
# Author: V. Jahnavi
# Project: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv11

from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

# Load YOLOv11 model (use pretrained weights)
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # You can replace with yolov11s.pt, yolov11m.pt, etc.

# Initialize webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 = default camera

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Perform detection
    results = model(frame)

    # Annotate frame with results
    annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow("YOLOv11 Real-Time Object Detection", annotated_frame)

    # Press 'q' to quit
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

🧠 Step 6: Explanation for README.md

Here’s the description you can put in your GitHub README file:

🎯 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv11
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for detecting multiple objects in a single image or video stream.
The system uses live webcam feed or video files and highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

🚀 Features

Detects multiple objects in real time

Uses YOLOv11 pre-trained model

Works with both webcam and video inputs

Lightweight and fast

Easy to customize for new classes

🧠 Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Ultralytics YOLOv11 – Deep learning detection model

OpenCV – Real-time video processing

PyTorch – Deep learning backend

NumPy – Numerical computations

⚙️ Installation Steps

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RealTime_Object_Detection_YOLOv11.git
cd RealTime_Object_Detection_YOLOv11


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the detector

python yolov11_detection.py


Press 'q' to stop the webcam feed.

📸 Example Output

When you run the code, it opens your webcam and detects objects in real-time — cars, persons, chairs, laptops, bottles, etc.

🧩 How It Works

YOLOv11 Model: Divides the image into grids and predicts bounding boxes + class probabilities.

OpenCV: Captures real-time frames from your camera.

Ultralytics Library: Runs YOLOv11 model inference.

Visualization: Detected objects are drawn on the frames with bounding boxes and labels.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add a custom dataset for specific object detection.

Integrate tracking (DeepSORT) to follow detected objects across frames.

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.

✅ Step 7: GitHub Upload Steps

Here’s how to upload it properly:

Go to GitHub
 → click New Repository.

Name it → RealTime_Object_Detection_YOLOv11.

Initialize with README.md (optional).

In your system:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - YOLOv11 real-time detection"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/RealTime_Object_Detection_YOLOv11.git
git push -u origin main


Would you like me to generate this entire project as a downloadable ZIP file (GitHub-ready) just like we did for your AI Job Recommendation System?
It will include:

Full code (yolov11_detection.py)

requirements.txt

README.md (professionally formatted)
